# phplba/routing

phplba/routing is a routing library that determines the right static or dynamic route based on a provided url in the most effective way.

You can associate any type of value to a route, the router just returns the right value and it is up to you to manipulate this return in order to call your constructors, hooks and any other elements you may need.

It is also your responsibility (for performance purposes) to provide the static and dynamic arrays and the regular expression needed for dynamic routing.
